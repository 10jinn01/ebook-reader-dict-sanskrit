Latest versions can be downloaded just here:

## Updating Dictionaries

If you do not fin a word or if a translation is not good for you, there is nothing to do here.
Everything should be changed on [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) directly.

All dictionaries are automatically re-generated every Sunday at midnight.
The `dicthml-LOCALE.zip` file is updated inplace so that the download link never changes.

## Adding a new Dictionary

[Pull requests](https://github.com/BoboTiG/ebook-reader-dict/pulls) are very welcome. It is quite straithforward to add a new locale:

0. Keep everything alphabetically sorted please.
1. Copy the reference file [lang/fr.py](scripts/lang/fr.py) into `lang/$LOCALE.py`. And apply changes to fit the new locale.
2. Update [lang/\_\_init__.py](scripts/lang/__init__.py) accordingly.
3. Create **empty** files:
   - `data/$LOCALE/words.count`
   - `data/$LOCALE/words.list`
   - `data/$LOCALE/words.snapshot`
4. Test it:
   ```shell
   # Install dependencies
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Export the locale you want to test
   export WIKI_LOCALE=$LOCALE

   # Run the command that will fetch the data and convert it into dicthtml-$LOCALE.zip
   # /!\ This command will take some time (from 15 to 45 minutes)
   python -m scripts
5. Optionally, but highly advisable: add [tests](tests/).

That's it! Thanks a lot for your contribution :heart:
