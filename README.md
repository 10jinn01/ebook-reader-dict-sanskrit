## Updating Dictionaries

If you do not fin a word or if a translation is not good for you, there is nothing to do here.
Everything should be changed on [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) directly.

All dictionaries are automatically re-generated every Sunday at midnight.
The `dicthml-LOCALE.zip` file is updated inplace so that the download link never changes.

## Adding a new Dictionary

[Pull requests](pulls) are very welcome.
In theory, you just have to add your language in [lang/](scripts/lang/) and it should work out-of-the-box!
